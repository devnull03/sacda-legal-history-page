    <p class="text-xl font-light">
      Canada, known for its multicultural society and commitment to human
      rights, has a history marked by discriminatory laws, policies, and
      practices targeted at various communities. This platform aims to shed
      light on the development of racist laws and practices against South Asians
      in Canada. Exploring the historical records, we seek to illuminate the
      adversities, obstacles, and victories of the South Asian community in
      dealing with systemic prejudice.

          Immigration Act 1906 and continuous journey Act 1908
        </h2>
        <p class="text-xl font-light">
          The Immigration Act of 1906 marked a significant shift towards
          stricter immigration policies. It broadened the list of forbidden
          immigrant categories, established a formalized deportation procedure,
          and granted the government expanded authority to exercise
          discretionary judgments regarding admission.<br /><br />
          An amendment to the Immigration Act was made in 1908 to incorporate the
          "continuous journey regulation" of the Canadian government, which forbade
          the entry into Canada of any immigrant who had not traveled continuously
          from the place of their birth or citizenship. As most voyages from the
          region involved stops, this posed a considerable obstacle to immigrants
          from South Asia.

        <p class="text-xl font-light">
          In 1920, the Dominion Elections Act resulted in the removal of federal
          voting privileges for those who had been denied the right to vote at
          the provincial level due to their ethnicity, particularly impacting
          people of Chinese, Japanese, and South Asian descent in British
          Columbia. Moreover, individuals of Chinese origin in Saskatchewan were
          also denied their right to vote.

        <h2 class="text-4xl font-medium w-full">The Komagata Maru Incident</h2>
        <p class="text-xl font-light">
          This incident unfolded during the spring and summer of 1914, just
          before the onset of the First World War. It turned out to be a
          harrowing and sorrowful ordeal for the passengers involved. Initially,
          there was an unsuccessful attempt at confrontation with officials,
          police, and the military at the Port of Vancouver. Subsequently, as
          the passengers returned to India, they faced a tragic and fatal clash
          with police and troops near Kolkata. The Komagata Maru tale
          illustrates the Canadian government's purposeful exclusionary policy
          toward ethnic groups it deemed unfit to enter. These defenses of
          Canada's continued status as a "White Man's Country" were couched in
          racist and ethnocentric notions of "progress," "civilization," and
          "suitability."
